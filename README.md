# Titanic Shipwreck Data Analysis with TensorFlow Neural Networks
### This repository contains the code and data files used for learning how to build neural networks using TensorFlow. The project uses the Titanic shipwreck dataset to train and test the neural network models.

## Project Overview
### The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify the survival outcomes of passengers onboard the Titanic based on various input features. The dataset contains information such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes that may influence their chances of survival.

### The project is implemented using Python and TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework. The neural network models are built using TensorFlow's Keras API, which provides a high-level interface for building and training deep learning models.


## Data
### The Titanic dataset used in this project contains information on 891 passengers, including whether they survived or not. The dataset can be found in the data folder of the repository, in the train.csv file.


## Results
### The neural network models were trained using various configurations of layers and parameters, and the best performing model achieved an accuracy of 83.3% on the test set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in solving classification problems, even with relatively small datasets such as the Titanic dataset.

## Conclusion
### This project provides an introduction to building neural networks using TensorFlow, using the Titanic dataset as an example. The code and data files can be used as a starting point for exploring other machine learning applications and datasets.
